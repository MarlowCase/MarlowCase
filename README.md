## Welcome to my Github Profile! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Marlow Case, and I am an aspiring Data Scientist with 5 years of programming experience and 5 more years of mathematical expertise. Bridging these together with interesting data sets is what motivates me to continuously learn new skills and solve complex problems. I am currently working as a Data Designer and Mathematics Expert in Columbia, MO, while expanding my knowledge in machine learning, predictive modeling, statistics, and data visualization through multiple mediums. 

Outside of work and studying I enjoy listening to music, playing board games, reading *(currently reading Dune)*, and am a puppy parent.

I'm currently working on a personal website that will serve as a hub for my featured projects to make browsing my work interesting and fun. In addition the website will outline my current skills, awards, and pursuits.  
When that is in a functional state, I will post the link here.
